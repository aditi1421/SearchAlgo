 1. Greedy Best First Search
 2. A* Algorithm 


driving.csv - with driving distances between state capitals.
straightline.csv - with straight line distances between state capitals.

Run Greedy Best First Search and A* algorithms searches to find a path between INITIAL and GOAL states and measure execution time (in seconds) for both methods.
